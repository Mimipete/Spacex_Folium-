Coursera Skills Notebook - IBM capstone Building an Interactive Map with Folium
<p> Launch Success rates depends on factors such as payload mass, orbit type etc. it's also depends on the location and proximities of a launch site, i.e, the initial position of rocket trajectories. <br>
<p> This analysis aims to find an optimal location for building a launch site by analyzing the existing launch site locations as there may be some preliminary correlations between launch site and launch success rates by performing an interactive visual analysis using Folium.
